# MNoFlinchNoWobble
Requires [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony/releases)

Requires my [workshop mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2870068059) to disabled explosion wobbles if using the default configs. Not needed if you only want to disable flinching or use your own explosion replacements.

Unturned rockemod plugin that removes the flinching effects from getting hurt and from explosions. 

Should work with modded explosions as of 1.2.0, but you must create your own workshop mod and add the ids to the config.
