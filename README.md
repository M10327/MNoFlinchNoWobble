# MNoFlinchNoWobble
Requires [Harmony](https://github.com/pardeike/Harmony/releases)

Requires my [workshop mod](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2870068059) to disabled explosion wobbles. Not needed if you only want to disable flinching.

Unturned rockemod plugin that removes the flinching effects from getting hurt and from explosions. Will not work with modded explosions.
